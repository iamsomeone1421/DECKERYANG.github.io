  <h1>The Stone Age</h1>
  <img src="Stone age image.jpg">
  <h4>The Stone age is a prehistoric period characterized by the creation and use of stone tules, hence earning the name, 'The Stone Age'. It is also the earliest known period of human history.<br> This period of time lasted approximately 3.4 million years. This marked the very beginning of metalworking.</h4>
  <h2>Different periods of The Stone Age</h2>
  <h3>The Paleothic Period (Old Stone Age)</h3>
  <p><Strong>Time frame:</Strong> Approximately 3.3 million years ago to around 10000 BCE</p>
  <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> This period is market by the use of simple stone tools by early hominids, including species like Homo Habilis and Homo Erectus. Humans in this time frame were mainly hunter-gatherers, relying on hunting, fishing and foraging for food and survival. The further developtment of more sophisticated and more efficient tools began in this time period.</p>
  <h3>The Mesolothic Period (Middle Stone Age)</h5>
  <p><strong>Time frame:</strong> Approximately 10000 BCE to around 5000 BCE</p>
  <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> This Transitional period followed the last Ice Age and saw the emergence and appearance of specialized tools for hunting and gathering. People started to adapt to the constantly changing environmental conditions, leading to more complex social structures like houses to be developed. Settled communties and villages were starting to appear in this time frame.</p>
  <h3>The Neolithic Period (New Stone Age)</h6>
  <p><strong>Time frame:</strong> Approximately 4000 BCE to around 3300 BCE</p>
  <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> The Neolithic era is defined by the advent and beginnning of agriculture, which allowed humans to permanantly settle in one place and form permanent communities. This period saw significant advancements in tool-making, pottery, and the domestication of animals. The term "Neolithic Revolution" describes the profound changes in human society brough about by agricultural practices.</p>
  <h2><Strong>The Significance of The Stone Age</Strong></h2>
  <p>The Stone Age represents a critical chapter in human history, encompassing the vast majority of our technological prehistory. It laid the foundation for subsequent develpments in human culture, technology and society, leading the the Bronze Age and beyond. The innovations and adaptations made during this period were essential for the survival and evolution of early human societies.<br> In summary, the Stone Age is a fascinating period that showcases the ingenuity and adaptability of early humans as they transitioned from simple tools users to complex agricultural societies.</p>
  <h2><strong>Stone Age Around the World</strong></h2>
  <p>The Stone Age timeline and cultural developments varied by region. For example, Aboriginal Australians are considered to have lived a Stone Age lifestyle for thousands of years longer than many other societies, maintaining traditional tool use and cuiltural practices into the Modern Era. <br><br>Understanding the Stone Age provides crucial insights into human evolution, adaptation, and the origin of many cultural and technological aspects still present today.</p>
